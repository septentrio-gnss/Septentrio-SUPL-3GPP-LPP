# Septentrio SUPL-3GPP-LPP-client
This repository is a fork from the [SUPL-3GPP-LPP-client](https://github.com/Ericsson/SUPL-3GPP-LPP-client) made by Ericsson. It contains additional support for Septentrio GNSS receiver to provide location data information.

---

## Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to facilitate the use of the LPP protocol over SUPL with a Septentrio GNSS receiver, facilitating the delivery of OSR RTCM corrections.


## Getting Started
To get started with the SUPL-3GPP-LPP-client and a Septentrio receiver, follow the [getting started](getting_started.md) guide.

This guide contains instruction on how to build and use the client as well as instructions on how to set up the receiver and modem.

## Tested Setup
The following setup was tested and is confirmed to work with the 3GPP LPP client.
- SBC : Raspberry Pi 4B (OS: Raspberry PI OS 64bit - 2023/05/03)
- GNSS Receiver : Septentrio Mosaic-Go
- Modem : D-Link DWM-222 (HW Ver: A2, SW Ver: 2.0.1 EU)

## What is SUPL ?
The SUPL (Secure User Plane Location) protocol is an IP protocol designed to transmit essential information for Assisted GPS (A-GPS) over a mobile network.

## What is LPP ?
LTE positioning protocol (LPP) is a point-to-point protocol that allows multiple connections to different devices and is used to position the target device.
LPP provides support for GNSS based positioning, network based positioning and hybrid â€“ a combination of both GNSS and network based positioning.

## Client

SUPL-3GPP-LPP-client is an example client for that connects to a location server using SUPL and requests assistance data using 3GPP LPP (Release 16.4). The code contains libraries for building a custom client for your specific needs. The example client is written in C++ and is designed to be portable and easy to use. It should be sufficient to get started or use as a simple client for testing.

The source code for the ASN.1 definitions from 3GPP LPP Release 16.4 are generated by ASN.1 C (https://github.com/vlm/asn1c). All other code is in C++ and should be portable to must unix-like systems. The example client is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Raspberry PI OS (32-bit) with gcc-4.8.
